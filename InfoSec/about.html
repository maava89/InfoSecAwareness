				<p>Information Security Awareness group is a small team of members who was founded in the first year of our study in Noroff University College, and we started as beginners in these subjects. However, we have come far in terms of knowledge and awareness.
				And we have learned that the modern society as it is now, are becoming more ignorant to the technology risen, and for that we want to aware people around us to become more alert to their sorroundings in both physical, technical security but also operational security.
