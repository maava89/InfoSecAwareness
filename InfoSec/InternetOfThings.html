<h2>Smart Devices</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<li>
<p>When we refer to IoT then we refer to all devices that are intelligent essentially. IoT stands for Internet of Things and is a broad topic when it comes to smart devices and the technology of the modern world. It can be any technology that is available to the public, from a smart phone to a light bulb controlled by your phone or PC, or your TV for that matter. Essentially all devices connected to the Internet. However, the more technology that emerges every day, the more security issues are there. 
Ask yourself this: Do you want to enjoy your various devices but at the same time not being exposed to hacking, phishing or any type of exploitation in terms of privacy or simply getting your credit cards robbed for all your money?
</p></li>
<h3><strong>How?</strong></h3>

<li><p></p>Get  a good Anti-virus for your various devices (PC, Smart phone). Preferred one  that includes with VPN, Cloud-Storage and a Password Manager.</li>
<li><p>Update your Smart Devices minimum once a month.</p></li>
<li><p>Have two separate networks to minimize Cyber Attacks, one where you connect your most used devices (Smart TV, Phone, PC). The other where you connect your less important devices (Smart Refrigerator, Light Bulbs, Smart Robot Vacuum Cleaner etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Change all your passwords regularly. Minimum once a month.</p></li>
		
<li><p>Never leave your Smart Devices unattended or open.</p></li>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<li><p>Better Security at your home or at your workplace.</p></li>
<li><p>Safety for your devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Safety for your credit cards.</p></li>
<h2><strong>The Dark Side of Smart Devices</strong></h2>
<p>When we think of smart devices, we only think about its availability and modern technology. However, one of the most used smart devices, are smart phones. We rely often on these devices to control our life, even when we donâ€™t need them. Therefore, we must admit that it is an addiction of sorts. And an even greater addiction is to our children and the newer generation of this time. We think of them not having cigarettes or drinking alcohol, but we equip them with Smart Devices in a daily basis. Have you asked yourself if smart devices and all this modern technology is the best to have in terms of health?</p>
<h3><strong>Here are some percussions and life-style choices that can be or may be applied:</strong></h3>
<li><p>Make up some basic rules at your home for restricting your smart devices. 
Example. Do not allow any smart devices around the dinner table.
</p></li>
<li><p>See whether you can be without your smart device (phone, tablet) from 25 minutes to 2 hours and so on, to test yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Your child should get a smart device as late as possible. We think that smart devices can help to raise your children for purposes that makes your life easier as a parent, but what they need is real input from you as a parent.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not let your child go to bed with a smart device, its even harder for our children to put the gadgets away than us. The results would be reduced sleep and harder concentration in school. Facebook will still be there the next day!</p></li>
